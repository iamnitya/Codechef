**Input Format**  
First line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.  
Each test case contains a single integer N - the weight of the pulp the factory has (in kgs).

**Output Format**  
For each test case, output the number of notebooks that can be made using N kgs of pulp.

**Constraints**  
1≤T≤100  
1≤N≤100  

**Sample Input**   
3  
1  
100  
50  

**Sample Output**   
10  
1000  
500  

**Explanation**
Test case-1: 1 kg of pulp can be used to make 1000 pages which can be used to make 10 notebooks.  
Test case-2: 100 kg of pulp can be used to make 100000 pages which can be used to make 1000 notebooks.
